**I am, Ahmad Rizky Nusantara Habibi**, a computer science student from Lombok, Indonesia. Curious to many things to know how the world is working. At first I made this blog mainly aimed to be my personal reference as a learning proccess for new things I found interesting which might be useful to document from my own understanding. But I feel that's so exciting if I can show my thoughts or anything else to the world which might be useful to others. My life purpose is being useful to others, like many people want. Writing blogs and create a computer program is one of good options that I choose to do that ðŸ˜‡.

### What I'm doing now
